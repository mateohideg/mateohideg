## Hi there 👋

## 📚 Status
Currently studying. Most of my public repositories are tools I built for secondary school. I’m working on personal projects that I plan to open-source in the future.

## 🛠 (Some of) My Stack
- **Languages:** TypeScript (primary), Go (sometimes)
- **Libraries:** React.js (past), Solid.js (current)

## 🎓 Goals
- Earn a Computer Science degree
- Open-source my personal projects (which are currently private)
